# My Professional Portfolio

Overview:
This project showcases my professional portfolio, demonstrating the achievement of learning outcomes for this semester. It's built using React and Tailwind CSS, technologies I chose to challenge myself and expand my skill set.

# Features:
React-based: Utilizes the power of React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Tailwind CSS: Implements modern, utility-first CSS framework for sleek design.
Project Showcase: Displays my work with detailed explanations.
Learning Outcomes: Clearly demonstrates semester achievements.

# Installation:
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can check their versions by running:
bash
node -v
npm -v

# To set up the project:
Create a new React app:
bash
npx create-react-app my-tailwind-app
cd my-tailwind-app

Install Tailwind CSS:
bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

Generate Tailwind configuration:
bash
npx tailwindcss init

Configure Tailwind CSS:
Update tailwind.config.js:
javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};

Add Tailwind directives:
In src/index.css, add:
css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
